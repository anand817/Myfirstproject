        <p class = "content">Researchers at the University of Science and Technology in China (USTC) worked out in 2018 how to secretly share "quantum keys" between orbiting satellites and ground stations, as Live Science previously reported. That made the connection between the Chinese Micius satellite and three ground sites it communicates with in Europe and Asia by far the largest secure quantum network in the world.

        <p class = "content">Yesterday (Feb. 7) marked the beginning of a new year on the Red Planet. While a year on Earth lasts 365 days, every Mars year lasts 668 sols (Mars days) — or 687 Earth days, as each sol lasts a little longer than an Earth day at 24 hours and 39 minutes. Because the Red Planet takes almost twice as long to orbit the sun as Earth, on Mars, you would celebrate your birthday every 23 Earth months.... <a href = "https://www.space.com/mars-new-year-2021-martian-year-36">Read More</a></p>

        <p class = "content">Since element 99 -- einsteinium -- was discovered in 1952 from the debris of the first hydrogen bomb, scientists have performed very few experiments with it because it is so hard to create and is exceptionally radioactive. A team of chemists has overcome these obstacles to report the first study characterizing some of its properties, opening the door to a better understanding of the remaining transuranic elements of the actinide series..... <a href = "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210206125326.htm">Read More</a></p>

        <p class = "content">In a new study, scientists improved memory of complex, realistic events by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the brain network responsible for memory. The researchers then had participants watch videos of realistic activities to measure how memory works during everyday tasks. The findings prove it is possible to measure and manipulate realistic types of memory..... <a href = "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210204144005.htm">Read More</a></p>
